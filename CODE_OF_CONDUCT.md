# Feature Branch Code of Conduct

As a contributor to this project, we ask that you follow these guidelines when creating feature branches:

1. **Use descriptive branch names:** When creating a new feature branch, use a name that clearly describes the feature you are working on. For example, if you are adding a new search feature, name your branch "add-search-feature" instead of something vague like "new-feature".

2. **Create branches from the latest main branch:** Always create your feature branch from the latest version of the main branch to ensure you are working on the most up-to-date code.

3. **Prefix branch names with issue numbers:** If you are creating a feature branch in response to an issue or task, prefix your branch name with the issue number. For example, if you are working on issue #123, name your branch "123-add-search-feature".

4. **Use hyphens to separate words:** When naming your branches, use hyphens (-) to separate words instead of underscores or spaces. This is a convention that is commonly used in Git.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that our feature branches are easy to understand, review, and merge, which will help us work more efficiently and produce high-quality code.

Examples of good branch names:
- 123-add-search-feature
- fix-typo-in-readme
- refactor-authentication-code
